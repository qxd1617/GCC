8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	gcc -c main.c circle.c
        
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	gcc -o broken main.o circle.o       
	
 
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	The program compiles because it only checks for integrity for the individual files themselves. As there is nothing technically wrong with main.c or circle.c, it does not see a problem and successfully compiles. During the linking step, however, references between files are checked and main.c makes a call to getAreas(), which does not exist anywhere in the linked libraries. Circle.c has a method called getArea(), but it is not recognized as it is mispelled.
