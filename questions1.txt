1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	/home/stu1/s5/qxd1617

2. What command will display the contents of your current
working directory, so that it shows the difference between
files and directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	ls -l	


3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	cd Courses

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	mkdir csci243

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -c warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems.
    
    a.) What compiler flag is used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	-Wall, (-Wextra and -Pedantic for additional checks)

    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c.
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	1. unused Variable 'b', the variable b is never returned or used anywhere in the code
	2. 'main' takes only zero or two arguments: int main() either has 0 arguments for no input from console, or two inputs, one to count the number of args and the other to contain the args themselves.
	3. unused parameter 'argc': Parameter is unused as it is not called anywhere by the code.
	4. control reaches end of non-void function (function 'compute'): The return type for the function compute(int a) is stated to be an integer, but the method does not return anything and so that generates a warning.
	5.'x' is uninitialized in this function: x is never initialized, just declared, and so it can be any random number and is useless without initialization.	    
    
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	gcc -std=c99
   
7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess
    D. Compile
    
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	A. Preprocess
	B. Compilation
	C. Assembly
	D. Linking
