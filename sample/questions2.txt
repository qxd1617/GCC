8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	It compiles because there is nothing technically grammatically wrong with either .c files. There is a method called getAreas in circle.c, but main.c calls getArea instead.
	As getArea() cannot be found in any of the linked files, the linking fails. Compilation will succeed as it does not check that all reference calls are valid. 
	But the linking step does, as such that step will fail.
